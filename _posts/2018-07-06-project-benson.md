title: Project Benson: How to query with Yelp's API
---

## Introduction

Project Benson enabled the opportunity to work with the NYC MTA turnstile data. The MTA turnstile data can be found [here](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html).The Yelp API was also used as an external source for more data support. This post will focus on how to utilize and leverage Yelp's API.

'''
pip install yelpapi
'''

Or if you prefer using Anaconda:

'''
conda install yelpapi
'''
